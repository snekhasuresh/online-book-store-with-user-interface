# online-book-store-with-user-interface
The project aims to provide a User interface for Users to buy, sell and also communicate with the sellers. 
Initially user needs to create own userid and password. The user can choose the book required either brand new or renewed from other people who wish to sell their books.
The main perspective is that it provides a unique user interface for the users to sell and also buy the books that are required. The user can choose and search the books required and if the users are willing to sell they can also sell to other existing users. There is a unique (one-one mail system) communication system in which the seller and customer can communicate.
